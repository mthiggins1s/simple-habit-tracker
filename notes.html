// Add Habit
This section creates a new habit entry when the user clicks the "add habit" button.

The addHabit() function retrieves the habit name from the input field
It validates that a name was entered (shows an alert if empty)
Creates a new habit div using the createHabitDiv() helper function
Adds the new habit to the page and clears the input field
Calls saveHabits() to persist the data
Sets up an event listener for the add habit button

// Delete Habit
This section handles removing habits from the tracker.

Sets up an event listener for the "remove habit" button
When clicked, it finds the last habit element in the container
If no habits exist, it shows an alert
Otherwise, it removes the last habit and calls saveHabits() to update storage

// Mark Complete
Though not explicitly labeled in your headers, this section:

Sets up an event listener for the "mark complete" button
Counts all checked checkboxes across all habits
Updates the total completed counter display
Calls saveHabits() to persist the updated state

// Create Habit Element
The createHabitDiv() function is a helper that:

Creates a new div element with the "habit" class
Sets its HTML to include a label with the habit name and a container for checkboxes
For each day of the week (from the imported daysOfWeek array), creates a checkbox
Generates unique IDs for each checkbox based on the habit name and day
Adds the checkboxes to the container
Returns the fully constructed habit div

// Save Habits to localStorage
The saveHabits() function handles data persistence:

Clears the current habits array
Gets all habit divs from the page
For each habit, extracts the name and the checked state of each checkbox
Stores this data in the habits array
Saves the array to localStorage as JSON

// Load Habits from localStorage
The loadHabits() function restores saved habits:

Checks if there are stored habits in localStorage
If found, parses the JSON data
For each saved habit, creates a new habit div
Sets the checkbox states to match the saved states
Adds the reconstructed habit to the page
This function runs when the page loads via an event listener
